# Methods
- pointcloud.c
    - stat1(); Reads a point cloud data stream and calculates
        - maximum height and its grid location
        - minimum height and its grid location
        - average height of all points
    - pointcloud_t* readPointCloudData(FILE *stream)
        - reads in data from a file stream
        - creates a pointcloud_t* to hold all of the data
        - returns a pointcloud_t* with all of the data
    - void imagePointCloud(pointcloud_t* pc, char* filename)
        - takes in a pointcloud_t* and a file name
        - determins grid demensions by the number of points
        - creates an image and saves it to the given file name
        - assigns a gray scale to each pixel based on its height
        - important note, is not longer used, replaced with imagePointCloudWater
    - void assignPointNeighbors(pointcloud_t* pc, int row, int col, pcd_t* point)
        - given a point and a pointcloud_t*, assign neighbors for all the points
    - int initializeWatershed(pointcloud_t* pc)
        - initilizes array and sets depth for water to 0
        - calls assignPointNeighbors to assign all neighbors
    - void watershedAddUniformWater(pointcloud_t* pc, double amount)
        - adds a uniform amount of water to the pointcloud_t*
    - void watershedStep(pointcloud_t* pc, double wcoef, double ecoef)
        - takes in the given coefficents as well as the pointcloud_t*
        - does the neccesary calculations on all points to simulate the water flow
    - double compute_f(double t1, double w1, double t2, double w2, double wcoef)
        - prefroms a calculation with given variables
    - void imagePointCloudWater(pointcloud_t* pc, double maxwd, char* filename)
        - takes in a pointcloud_t* and a file name
        - determins grid demensions by the number of points
        - creates an image and saves it to the given file name
        - assigns a gray scale to each pixel based on its height
        - also asigns a blue shade to each cell based on water depth

- pointcloud.h
    - contains all function prototypes
    - contains the pcd_t structure which is what the pointcloud data is stored in
        - This has variables for x, y, z, and water depth
        - Has 4 pointcloud pointers north, south, east, and west
    - contains the pointcloud_t structure representing
        - a list of points objects
        - number of rows
        - number of columns

- util.c
    - double** allocateArray(int rows, int columns)
        - takes in # of rows and columns and returns a double** arr
        - frees the neccesary memory for the array
    - void freeArray(double** arr, int rows)
        - frees the given array
    - int listInit(List* l, int max_element_size)
        - takes in a list pointer l and an int
        - returns a 0 if success
        - creates a default structure for a list with default max size of 10
        - frees the neccesary data for structure
    - void listAddEnd(List* l, void* elmt)
        - takes in a list pointer and a void pointer for element
        - adds this element to the end of the list and increments the size
    - void* listGet(List* l, int index)
        - takes in a list pointer and a index
        - returns the element at that index if it exists

- util.h
    - contains all function prototypes
    - contains macro for INDEX_2D
    - also contains the struct for List
        - This struct has variables for max_size, max_element_size, data, and size
    
- watershed.c
    - contains the main function 
        - which takes in these arguments
            - the input file
            - the number of iterations to run
            - the starting amount of water
            - the water flow coefficent (must be between 0.0-0.2)
            - the water evaporation coefficent (must be between 0.9-1.0)
            - the destination to save the files
            - the max water depth
            - the number of iterations to run before creating an output image
        - checks each parameter to make sure their are no errors
        - calls runProject to start the simulation
    - void runProject(pointcloud_t *pc, int iter, double iwater, double wcoef, double ecoef, char *ofilebase, double maxwdepth int seq)
        - takes in all of the parameters from main
        - runs through each iteration calling neccesary functions when needed
        - prints out final image 
        - frees all neccesary memory
